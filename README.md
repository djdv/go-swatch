# go-swatch

## What?
Utility functions to convert Go `time`'s into [Swatch Internet Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time).  
A decimal time relative to the Biel, Switzerland timezone, at a ration of 1,000 ".beats" per 24 hour day.

## Why?
I needed a way to get various times in .beats so I could pretend to be funny on IRC.
